<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Daylight Harvesting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Loop</li><li>Partial Open Loop</li><li>Open Loop</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Daylight harvesting markets can be classified into three types: closed loop, partial open loop, and open loop. Closed loop systems rely solely on artificial lighting and daylight sensors to optimize energy use without external input. Partial open loop systems incorporate some external daylight influence but still use controlled artificial lighting. Open loop systems fully leverage natural daylight for illumination, often minimizing artificial lighting requirements. Each type varies in how it integrates and utilizes daylight to enhance energy efficiency.</p></p>
