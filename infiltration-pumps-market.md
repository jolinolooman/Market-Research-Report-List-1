<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infiltration Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non Conductive Roller Head</li><li>Conductive Roller Head</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the infiltration pumps market, two primary types are identified based on roller head characteristics: non-conductive roller heads and conductive roller heads. Non-conductive roller heads are typically made from materials that do not conduct electricity, making them suitable for sensitive applications where electrical safety is a concern. On the other hand, conductive roller heads are designed for environments where electrical conductivity is needed, facilitating efficient operations in tasks like dewatering and fluid transfer in various industrial settings. Each type serves distinct operational requirements.</p></p>
