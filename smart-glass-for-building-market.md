<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Glass for Building Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Glasses</li><li>Passive Glasses</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart glass technology for buildings is categorized into two main types: active and passive glasses. Active glasses, such as electrochromic and thermochromic glass, require an external power source to change opacity or color, allowing for dynamic control of light and heat. Passive glasses, on the other hand, utilize materials that naturally respond to environmental conditions, such as photochromic glass, which darkens in sunlight. Both types enhance energy efficiency, privacy, and user comfort in modern architectural designs.</p></p>
