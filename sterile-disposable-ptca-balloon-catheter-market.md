<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sterile Disposable PTCA Balloon Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Semi Compliant</li><li>Non Compliant</li><li>Compliant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sterile disposable PTCA balloon catheter market features three main types: semi-compliant, non-compliant, and compliant balloons. Semi-compliant balloons expand to a moderate degree under pressure, suitable for moderate lesions. Non-compliant balloons maintain their size even at high pressure, ideal for high-pressure applications and precise dilation. Compliant balloons, on the other hand, expand significantly at lower pressures, making them useful for treating softer lesions. Each type serves specific clinical needs, optimizing patient treatment outcomes in cardiovascular interventions.</p></p>
